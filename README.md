## 📄 Abstract

This study analyzes the correlation between coating thickness and flow variables in FOWLP chambers. Strong linear relationships were found between average pressure and coating uniformity, especially in hole-type designs. Slit chambers with baffles also showed improved correlation under stable pressure conditions. The results suggest that chamber geometry and flow control are key to process stability.

#### ⚠️ Notes
- Pearson’s 𝑟 measures only linear correlation.
- It is sensitive to outliers.
- A high correlation does not imply causation.
- For non-linear relationships, consider alternatives (e.g., Spearman’s rank correlation).

## ✅ Conclusion

In hole chambers, coating uniformity is strongly influenced by average pressure regardless of baffle use. In slit chambers, adding a baffle significantly enhances flow stability and coating quality, especially at low pressure. Pressure fluctuation consistently correlates with coating thickness variation. Optimizing structure and pressure is essential for uniform film formation.
